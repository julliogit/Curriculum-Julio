% Tips for CV
% -------------------------------
% Here are some tips for writing your CV. These tips are more specific to this CV and its functionality.

% Languages:
% *******************
% This CV can be written in many languages. The bibliography and most of the document can be adjusted with babel. 
% The exception is some custom commands that are defined in the CV.cls:
%  - \LngTextCEFR (english, norsk, nynorsk)
%  - \LngTextILR (english, norsk, nynorsk)
%  - \pubtitle (english only)
% You can modify these commands in the .cls for other languages. For pubtitle, you can use 
%     \pubtitle[<Text>][<symbol>]{Custom}
% to display another language.
% The 'Page' text in the header on page 2 imports the babel key for 'page' from the current language.

% Sections:
% *******************
% You can use the table format to neatly format text in sections. If you want three columns you use
%  \begin{CV_table} and for two columns, you use \begin{CV_text}. The black separation line will 
% in both environments will align with each other.
% If you want you can also just write plain text in each section, or use your own table.

% Formatting:
% *******************
% The second column is optional on both page one and page two. You can chose between one column or two columns.
% For one column: Comment out \begin{CVbody} and \end{CVbody}. Also, comment out the \include{Txt/p1_sidebar.tex}.
% If you do not have publications, or do not want an extencive list, you can drop the section altogether or just
% write in plain text "have published x articles and ...". 

% Pages:
% *******************
% I included an error that makes the document crash and not compile if if exceeds 2 pages. This is to 
% encourage short CVs, as it is generally agreed upon that a CV should be 1-2 pages long. Try to keep 
% your CV short and precise, as it is estimated that recruiters on average look at your CV for 
% only 6-7 seconds! 
% Should you want to make 2 or more CVs that are similar, you can include the class option multipleCVs.
% This can be great if you need two similar CVs, but not identical ones. The page 2 text is set to be printed
% at every other page, so you may want to leave a blank page with \blankpage if your CV is only 1 page long.
% You can then use \makeCVheader at each new CV and have a different linkeheader (or the same) and different 
% profile, etc.

% Application letter:
% *******************
% It may be wise to have a job application letter in the same style/ formatting as the CV, as this appears
% more professional. I also have a job application template you can use. 

% Fonts, font size and paper size:
% *******************
% These adjustments are not yet supported properly and not work properly in all cases. If you want 
% smaller section titles, this can be achieved doing 
%     {<font adjustments>\MakeUppercase{<Title>}\\[1ex]\linia\medskip}
% When adjusting paper size, the CVtable columns may be off, as the first column have a set length.
